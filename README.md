# SIMILARITIES ACROSS STUDIES

1. CORE RESEARCH QUESTION

---

All studies investigate the relationship between:

- Media consumption (multitasking, social media, short-form videos)
- Attention-related outcomes (attention span, sustained attention, concentration)
- Academic/performance outcomes (GPA, marks, academic performance)

2. CONSISTENT FINDINGS

---

Negative Associations:

- ALL studies find negative relationships between media multitasking/short-form video consumption and attention outcomes
- ALL studies examining academic performance find negative correlations
- Higher consumption consistently associated with:
  - Lower attention span/sustained attention
  - Poorer academic performance
  - Increased distraction
  - Difficulty concentrating

Effect Size Patterns:

- Most studies report moderate effect sizes (r = 0.20-0.45 range)
- Negative correlations consistently found across different samples and measures
- Academic performance effects are modest but consistent (typically explaining 7-25% variance)

3. METHODOLOGICAL SIMILARITIES

---

Sampling Methods:

- ALL empirical studies use non-probability sampling (convenience, volunteer, purposive)
- Student populations are common across studies
- Age ranges typically focus on young adults (17-35 years)

Data Collection:

- Self-report questionnaires are used in ALL empirical studies
- Likert scales commonly used for measuring perceptions and behaviors
- Time-based measures (hours/day, frequency) are standard across studies

4. SHARED LIMITATIONS

---

Cross-Sectional Design:

- ALL empirical studies are cross-sectional (except review paper)
- Cannot establish causation - unclear direction of relationship
- Cannot determine if media use causes attention problems or vice versa

Self-Report Bias:

- ALL studies rely heavily on self-reported data
- No objective validation of reported media use in most studies

Generalizability Issues:

- ALL studies acknowledge limited generalizability
- Convenience sampling limits broader population inferences
- Geographic/cultural specificity (Hong Kong, Kosovo, India, US)

Confounding Variables:

- ALL studies acknowledge unmeasured confounds
- Study habits, coursework hours, individual differences not fully controlled
- Demographics (SES, device type, content type) often not fully accounted for

5. COMMON MEASUREMENT APPROACHES

---

Media Consumption Measurement:

- Time-based metrics (hours/day) used across ALL studies
- Frequency measures (daily, weekly patterns) common
- Platform-specific usage tracking

Attention Assessment:

- Self-reported attention/concentration difficulties (most studies)
- Objective tasks used in some (GradCPT, SART) but not all
- Academic performance as proxy for attention in some studies

# Research Gaps and Future Directions

Future Research Priorities:

1. Longitudinal studies to establish causality
2. Intervention studies (digital detox, mindfulness, time management)
3. Experimental designs with controlled exposure
4. Neuroscientific validation (fMRI, EEG)
5. Platform-specific comparative studies
6. Age and developmental stage analyses
7. Cultural and socioeconomic moderators
